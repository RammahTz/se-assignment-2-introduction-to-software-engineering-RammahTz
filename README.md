Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Answer: 
>> Software engineering is a discipline that involves the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.

>> Software engineering differ from traditional programing becuase traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve immediate problems, software engineering takes a more holistic approach to software development, considering the entire lifecycle of the software and emphasizing principles of engineering and best practices.

>> software Develpoment life Cycle (SDL) this is the term used in softwre industry to discribe the process of creating new software product so this is the process of planning, writting ,modifying and maintaining software product. There are seven stage of SDL and six common model that are used in different projects.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Answer;
>>there are seven(7) phase of software development life cycle which are:-
A. PLANNING AND BRAINSTROMING
   Planinng is the first step in software development, Because it is when you set the team for brainstromingseting the goal and identify Risk so in planning is where we can allocate the resource and set the timeline 
B. ANALYZE REQUIREMENT
   After having the idea is time to organize the plan and design.  This need alot of research so that the final product meets expectation
C. DESIGN AND MOCKUP
   Creating a high-level design of the system architecture and detailed design of individual components/modules.
D. Develop code 
   The development phase is where coding begins to take place.This phase often requires extensive programming skills and knowledge of databases
E. TESTING THE PRODUCT
   Before releasing the mockups into final production, you'll need to test it to ensure it is free of bugs and errors
F. Implimenting and lunching the product
   This is the time to make the system to be used by customer. you need to market your product so the that people know the existance of the product 
G. SET UP MAINTAINANCE AND OPERATIONS
   The final stage of the software development life cycle is maintenance and operations
   Maintainance is involve updating an existance software product to fix bug and ensure liability

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Answer:-
>>AGILE MODEL 
The Agile software development process aims to deliver high-quality software early, often, and at a low cost. Agile methods prioritize working software over comprehensive pre-planning and documentation, which can slow the creative process.It is a modern approach with short phases that works well when software requirements are likely to emerge as the development process begins

>>WATERFALL MODEL
Waterfall is a sequential design process that moves in a straight line from one phase to the next.This approach is used  when the requirements for a product are well-defined and resources are available. Also it can perform inconsistently if requirements change frequently.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANSWER:-Agile and Waterfall are two contrasting methodologies for software development, each with its own set of principles, processes, and advantages. Here's a comparison:
Waterfall is characterized by its sequential nature and upfront planning, whereas Agile is known for its flexibility, iterative approach, and emphasis on collaboration and customer feedback. The choice between the two methodologies often depends on the project's requirements, team dynamics, and client preferences.

THE KEY DIFFERENT
 The different between agile and waterfall model of software development is waterfall is the liner and sequence model it is from one phase to the next BUT Agile is collaborative, flexible and contineous improvement

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
>>Answer
Reqiurement engineering is is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system  OR is a systematic process used in engineering projects to define, document, and maintain requirement
process of requirment engineering
>>Requirement Elicitation: This is the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders. It involves various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, brainstorming sessions, and observation. The goal is to understand the needs, expectations, and constraints of the stakeholders.

>>Requirement Analysis: In this phase, the gathered requirements are scrutinized to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and unambiguous. Conflicts and discrepancies among requirements are resolved. This phase often involves modeling techniques to represent requirements visually.

>>Requirement Specification: This step involves documenting the requirements in a formal and detailed manner. The specification can take various forms, including natural language documents, use cases, user stories, or formal specifications. The aim is to provide a clear and precise description of the system to be developed.

>>Requirement Validation: This phase ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. Techniques such as reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and prototyping are used to validate requirements. This step helps to identify any misunderstandings or missing requirements before development begins.

>>Requirement Management: Throughout the project lifecycle, requirements may change due to evolving stakeholder needs, market conditions, or technical constraints. Requirement management involves tracking and controlling changes to the requirements to ensure that the impact of changes is understood and managed effectively. Tools like requirement traceability matrices are often used in this phase.
SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLE 
The following are software design Principle
 >>Should not suffer from “Tunnel Vision” –
 While designing the process, it should not suffer from “tunnel vision” which means that is should not only focus on completing or achieving the aim but on other effects also.

   >>Traceable to analysis model –
The design process should be traceable to the analysis model which means it should satisfy all the requirements that software requires to develop a high-quality product.

>>Should not “Reinvent The Wheel” –
The design process should not reinvent the wheel that means it should not waste time or effort in creating things that already exist. Due to this, the overall development will get increased.

>>Minimize Intellectual distance –
The design process should reduce the gap between real-world problems and software solutions for that problem meaning it should simply minimize intellectual distance.

>>Exhibit uniformity and integration –
The design should display uniformity which means it should be uniform throughout the process without any change. Integration means it should mix or combine all parts of software i.e. subsystems into one system.

>>Accommodate change –
The software should be designed in such a way that it accommodates the change implying that the software should adjust to the change that is required to be done as per the user’s need.

>>Degrade gently –
The software should be designed in such a way that it degrades gracefully which means it should work properly even if an error occurs during the execution.

>>Assessed or quality –
The design should be assessed or evaluated for the quality meaning that during the evaluation, the quality of the design needs to be checked and focused on.

>>Review to discover errors –
The design should be reviewed which means that the overall evaluation should be done to check if there is any error present or if it can be minimized.

>>Design is not coding and coding is not design –
Design means describing the logic of the program to solve any problem and coding is a type of language that is used for the implementation of a design.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
ANSWER
   Modularity in software design is a fundamental principle that involves dividing a software system into discrete, manageable units or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific functionality or a set of related functions.
